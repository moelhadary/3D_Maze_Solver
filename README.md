This C program solves a 3D maze using a breadth-first search algorithm. It can find a path from a starting cell to an ending cell in a 3D maze represented as a multi-level grid.

## Features

- Solves 3D mazes with multiple levels.
- Uses breadth-first search to find the shortest path.
- Includes a sample 3D maze for testing.
